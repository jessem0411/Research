# Thesis Research
My research during my master's is to propose a novel set-membership state estimation algorithm for LTI systems under Unknown But Bounded (UBB) inputs. 
The proposed algorithm is based on decomposing the given system into strongly observable and weakly unobservable subsystem, and applying appropriate observer (Unknown Input
Observer and Ellipsoidal Set-Membership Algorithm) for each subystem, and fusing the two set estimates into a set estimate of the original state. Our algorithm has better accuracy
than existing set membership algorithms as well as reduced computational complexity.
